BetterClocks
============

BetterClocks adds the world time (in hours and minutes) as a line of lore to all clocks.

**Features**
*   Dynamically updates.
*   Works in containers like chests.
*   Works in Nether.
*   Right-click with clock to check the time. 

**Known Problems**
*   Stacking clocks is problematic because the world time is constantly updating, and the game does not support stacking      items with different lore.

**To Do**
*   Find workaround for stacking clocks.
